/* 1. CSS basically gives style to the Raw HTML...
   2. CSS stands for the Cascading style sheets..
   3. CSS is used to give style to our web pages..
   4. CSS is used to make the websites responsive..
   5. HTML is used to structure a website..
   6. CSS takes the responsibility of the Styling..*/

   /* So now we have to know how to erite CSS so basically the syntax of the CSS is given
   
          p { color : blue ; }
          
          so the p means that paragraph as all the paragraphs on the web page may be of this 
          color apply the property...basically the p is the any kind of the selector..

          Here the color is Property..

          And the blue is value of the property ...

          so if there are so many paragraphs and ypou want a particular paragraph so this is may be read
          later in the course and bss itna smjh ly k kuch tarah ka selector hota or by id b kr skty..

          so there may be the group of the selectors and the syntax is given:::::
          header , p.intro
                        {background-color : red;
                           border- radius : 3px;
                        }

        -------->> so the ( header,p.intro ) is the group of the selectors and 
        -------->> and the {*********} whatever in the brackets is the declaration block...

        so basicallty there are many ways of adding CSS

        1. Inline CSS -- (in this way we add the CSS in the tag as <p style = "**"></p>)
        but there is so many drawbacks of this wasy..

        2. Internal CSS -- (this means that the markup in the header tag is removed and 
                            and add a new tag the style tag and the CSS in the style tag..)

        So this is better but what if the code is of 1000 of the lines so i want to add and write 
        CSS in the separate file so i can do this..

        3. External CSS -- (in this way we have to write the CSS in the Separate file as ali.css
        so i can add in the markup of HTML language...
        so there are two steps in the External...

        a. Write CSS in the separate file as ali.css..
        b. Include that CSS file in the file..
