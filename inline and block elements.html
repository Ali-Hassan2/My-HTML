a is a inline elemnt -->
<a style="border: 2px solid blue" >This is a paragraph..</a>
<a style = "border: 2px solid red">This is also a paragraph..</a>


    <!-- as i check this the second paragraph is on the new line and i want it is place with the 
    first line so it is placed at the new line because this is a block element so if i have to 
use span instead of the p then it will placed on the with the 1st line -->

<span style="border: 2px solid red">This is a span</span>
<span style ="border: 2px solid blue">This is also a span</span>
