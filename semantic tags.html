<h3>Semantic Tags</h3>
<!-- There are different tags as of such types  

1. <header> Tag is used to show that this is the header
2. <nav> so this is used to show that this is tha navigation bar so when you give the website
    link to the previews such as fb instagram they can easily recognixe the section=s of the 
    websites by the tags...
3. <article> tag is used
4. <aside> tag is used
5. <footer> is used to show the footer of the web page..-->
